The project is a mix of hardware and software. It is a portable device and mobile app designed to monitor and manage stress levels in real-time. By detecting irregular heart rate peaks through sensors or integration with an Apple Watch, the device helps users recognize signs of stress and provides personalized strategies to deal with it. This project aims to support mental well-being through proactive interventions, real-time notifications, and ongoing data analysis.

## Features
- **Heart Rate Monitoring**: Continuously tracks heart rate to detect irregularities indicating stress or anxiety.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts users when stress is detected and suggests calming activities.
- **Personalized Interventions**: Provides tailored relaxation techniques, breathing exercises, and mindfulness activities.
- **Stress Tracking & Analytics**: Offers insights into stress patterns and progress over time.
- **Emergency Contact Notification**: Notifies a designated contact in case of severe stress events.
- **Daily Check-ins**: Prompts users to regularly assess their mood and well-being.

## Technologies Used
### Hardware
- **Heart Rate Sensor**: High-precision sensor to monitor heart rate.
- **Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) Sensor**: Measures skin conductance as an indicator of stress.
